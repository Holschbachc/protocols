# Autoclave

## Autoclave Table

| Cycle | Uses |
|:---:|:---:|
| p8 | Dry supplies and tip trash (clear bag) |
| p13  | Non-agar liquid media (<1 Liter) |
| p14  | Everything else (liquid media, glycerol stocks, orange bag trash, etc.) |

## Autoclave etiquette

- DO NOT USE A LARGE AMOUNT OF AUTOCLAVE TAPE! Autoclave tape is VERY expensive, so we conserve as much as possible.
  - Do not use more than 2-3 slashes per piece of tape.
- When putting the tape on, make sure to fold one end over and stick it to itself (Dog earring). This gives us an easy place to grab to remove the tape.
- When autoclaving media, do NOT put more than 3 liters in at one time. This will ensure that all of the media will be autoclaved evenly.
- If you are taking media out of the autoclave, it is best practice to gently rinse out the inside of the autoclave with water after use. This prevents salt build-up in the autoclaves, which can be EXTREMELY detrimental to our autoclaves.
  - To do this, use the hose on the right side of the rightmost autoclave. There is a valve to turn on water to the hose, also along the right wall.
  - Once turned on, unscrew the end of the hose to begin getting a gentle stream of water from the nozzle. DO NOT MAKE THE STREAM VERY STRONG! Too much water will create a large cloud of stream, which will at the very least get you very wet, and could potentially burn you.
  - Once you have gently rinsed out the autoclave, you’re all set. 
## Tip Trash (the clear bag)
- Can be found in the orange wireframe holder near the main lab entrance. This can be treated as a “Dry” load, and can be autoclaved on P2.
- Once the run is finished, stick a green “Ok to Trash” sticker on the bag and toss it into the trashcan in the autoclave room.
- The liquid in the bin should just be autoclave steam and can be washed out down the drain and the bin left to dry/reuse.
  - If you cannot find ‘OK to Trash’ stickers in lab, you can find more on the first floor in the mail room by the printer.
## Biohazard Plate Trash (orange bag)
- The orange biohazard bags contain agar plates and cannot be run on a “Dry” load or they will boil over in the tray and make a huge mess. These must always be run on cycle P14, and the bags shouldn’t be so full that they bulge way out over the tray.
- Once the run is finished, stick a green “Ok to Trash” sticker on them and the bags should be tossed into the trashcan in the autoclave room.
  - **THE LIQUID IN THE TRAY CANNOT BE PUT DOWN THE DRAIN**. This isn’t water, but actually some melted agar that will resolidify and clog pipes if it goes down the sink.
  - Instead, take the tray to the “Daily Bin Bucket”, an instant ocean bucket you have put an orange autoclave bag into. Pour the liquid into the bag and rinse the tray clean in the sink of any remaining residue.
  - **AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU MUST TIE UP THE BAG, STICK AN “OK TO TRASH” STICKER ON IT, AND TOSS IT INTO THE AUTOCLAVE ROOM TRASH.**
    - Bin Buckets left to sit for >1 day will quickly grow new bacteria/mold and become a new biohazard/horrific stench glob. If you do run into this situation, autoclave the bag with the autoclave room’s door closed and toss it in the trash.
## Dry Supplies
- Typically, dry supplies are run at the end of the day.
  - The reasoning for this is that condensation tends to build up in our supplies, and if you leave them overnight, the condensation will evaporate out.
- When autoclaving, run on the p8 cycle, which is roughly 60 minutes.
- After autoclaving, vent the door on the autoclave by opening slightly and leaving a slit at the top of the door.
  - This allows the water vapor to escape, removing that condensation.
- Remove the dry supplies first thing on the next day, and let cool on the bench for 30 minutes - 1 hour.
- Put dry supplies away in their respective locations in lab.
