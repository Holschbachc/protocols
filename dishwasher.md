# Dishwasher use protocol

* Glassware to be dish-washed will be placed to the right side of the sink. Once the counter next to the sink is almost completely covered, grab the cart and wheel over to the sink. Place all glassware on the cart and wheel to the autoclave room.
  * Before running the washer, you must first ensure that all glassware has no tape or sharpie markings. To remove sharpie marks, wet a paper towel with 100% Acetone (red bottle) and wipe the writing off. Rinse with DI after wiping.
* Once in the autoclave room, open up the dishwasher and begin loading the dishes.
  * If you have caps, stir bars, and metal spatulas, place them on the top rack. To make sure they don’t get thrown around, place the extra rack on top of them. You can usually find this sitting on top of the dishwasher.
  * If you have large beakers, you won’t be able to have the top rack in the dishwasher. Remove the top rack and place it on top of the dishwasher. Once done, put it back in the dishwasher.
* Once dishes are loaded, close the door and run program 2 (~60 minutes). Note: you may need to slam the door fairly hard for it to close!
* Remove dishes and place them on the drying rack in the back of the lab for one day.
  * Small glassware often gets blown off the washer prongs and can fall into the bottom of the dishwasher. Please check the trough after each run.

## Replacing Detergent
* If the dishwasher is giving you trouble, chances are that the detergent is empty and needs to be replaced. There are two containers under the dishwasher; acid and detergent. Check to see which of these containers needs to be replaced. To the right of the dishwasher, you can find stocks of all of the reagents needed. Grab a new bottle, and screw the cap with the tube in it into the new bottle. Once placed back under the dishwasher, you should be good to go!
