# Refilling Bottles and Dispensers around Lab

## 70% Ethanol

- You can find our stock of 70% ethanol in the flammable cabinet to the left of the fume hood.
- If that stock is empty, fill the bottle with 100% ethanol to the Sharpie mark on the side of the container.
- Fill the rest with DI water and shake.

## 10% Bleach

- You can find our bleach under the sink by the media bench.
- If the 10% bottle is empty, prepare more by adding 100 mL of 100% bleach to the graduated cylinder marked ‘bleach’.
- Add 900 mL of DI water to the beaker.
- Pour into the jug labeled 10% and give a good shake.

## Paper towel

- Paper towels can be found in the cabinet, wrapped in tan paper.
- Tear off the paper and place it in the paper towel dispenser.

## Hand Soap

- Our large stock of hand soap can be found under the sink by the bleach.
- Refill the dispenser using this stock, and you’re good to go!
