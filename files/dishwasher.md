## When to wash

- Glassware to be dish-washed will be placed to the right side of the sink. Once the counter next to the sink is almost completely covered, the glassware needs to be washed in the machine.

## Prepare the glassware

- Ensure that all tape and sharpie markings are removed from glassware.
  - To remove sharpie marks, add 100% Acetone (red bottle) to a paper towel and use the towel to wipe the writing off. Rinse the glassware with DI after wiping.

## Move glassware to the autoclave room

- Grab a lab cart and wheel it over to the sink.
- Place all glassware on the cart.
- Wheel the cart to the autoclave room.

## Check detergent level

- There are two containers under the dishwasher: `Lancer Acid` and `Lancer Detergent`. Ensure that liquid is visible in both containers before use.
- If either needs refilling, ensure that you coordinate with a senior laboratory member.
- Replacement stocks are to the right of the machine.
- If a new bottle is needed, grab a new bottle, and screw the cap with the tube in it into the new bottle. Once placed back under the dishwasher, you should be good to go!

## Operate the Lancer dishwasher

- Once in the autoclave room, open up the dishwasher and load the dishes.
  - If you have caps, stir bars, and metal spatulas, place them on the top rack. To make sure they donâ€™t get thrown around, place the extra rack on top of them. You can usually find this sitting on top of the dishwasher.
  - If you have large beakers, remove the top dishwasher rack from the machine and place it on top of the dishwasher to ensure there is room for those beakers. Once the wash is done, replace the rack back in the dishwasher.
- Once dishes are loaded, close the door and run `Program 2` (~60 minutes). Note: you may need to slam the door fairly hard for it to close!

## Dry the glassware

- Remove glassware onto the cart, and place each item onto the drying rack in the back of the lab next to the Biosafety cabinet.
  - Small glassware often gets blown off the washer prongs and can fall into the bottom of the dishwasher. Please check the trough after each run.
- Items should air dry for one day.
