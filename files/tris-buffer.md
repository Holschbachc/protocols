# Making Tris Buffer

## Adding the salts

1. Grab a 2 liter plastic Nalgene beaker and bring to media bench.
  -  You can find these in the cabinet next to the biosafety hood.
2. Grab a large weigh boat and measure out 254 grams of Tris Hydrochloride and 47.2 grams of Tris Base and add them to the beaker.
3. Add DI water to the 1.9 liter mark on the flask.
  - Don't use the markings on the grad cylinder! The salts take up volume, which means 1.9 liters of water is not actually 1.9 liters in the flask. Please fill to the 1.9 liter mark on the beaker, NOT the grad cylinder! 
4. Add a large stir bar and completely dissolve salts.

## Calibrating the pH meter

1. Remove the parafilm around the top of the probe.
    - You will notice a hole. There is fluid in this probe. Make sure you don't accidentally pour it out of the probe or put the hole into liquid.
2. Prep calibration tubes by filling pre-labeled 50 mL conicals with their respective liquids.
3. Fill each tube with its corresponding solution located in the drawer under the pH meter.
    - Next to the pH meter, you will find a red rack with three 50 mL conicals, labeled 4.01, 7.00, and 10.01. 
     - You will know you have the correct solutions if they are pink, blue, and yellow in color.
      - Add 10-15 mL of solution in each tube. You don’t need to fill the tubes to the top!
4. Use the clamps to hold the probe in a conical with the 7 pH solution in it.
    - Don’t let the probe touch the bottom.
5. Turn on the machine and press calibrate. Wait until it has stabilized, and then remove the probe from the liquid.
6. Rinse probe with DI water using the squirt bottle. Collect this water in a tripour located next to the pH meter.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 with the 4 and 10 pH calibration fluids, rinsing with DI between each tube change.

## Stabilizing the pH of your buffer

1. Place the probe into your beaker, and hit ‘read’.
2. Gently stir the Tris Buffer (~200 RPM) on a stir plate.
  - This will diffuse all salts evenly.
  - Wait until value stabilizes before proceeding.
3. Add 6M HCl, found in the acids cabinet, using the plastic pipette to lower the pH.
  - Begin with 3 full pipettes and gauge where you are at. Keep adding HCl until the buffer reaches a pH of 7.5.
  - If you overshoot and you drop below 7.5, don’t panic, you will just need to add NaOH, found in the bases cabinet.
4. Once pH of 7.50 is achieved, remove the probe and rinse with DI.
5. Place the probe back into the probe housing and wrap the hole with a small amount of parafilm.
  - You need to hold the probe while wrapping or it will drop too deep into the holder.
6. Fill the beaker with DI water to the 2 liter mark.
7 . Pour your fresh Tris buffer into a large carboy.
8. Change label tape on the carboy to today's date, your initials, and the pH.
