# Mandel Lab Safety Plan for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19

Updated 2020-03-16

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 is presenting all of us with new challenges. The goals of this plan is to ensure the health of lab members, promote health in the broader community, prepare for experimental disruption, and ensure that research animals are treated humanely. As much as it is frustrating to have work delayed or deferred, COVID-19 is a serious disease. It is imperative that we protect ourselves and protect the greater community.

## Lab Operating Level

There are already some restrictions, with more anticipated soon. This plan considers the following levels of restriction, with a focus on the current level of `Restricted Operations`.

1. Normal Operations
2. **Restricted Operations - Current level**
3. Lab Closure, Animal Care Only
4. Full Lab Closure

## Take the following steps for the current level

1. **If you can conduct your work from home, do not come into lab.** This includes writing, coding, reading, etc. Additionally, if you do not want to come to the lab, please work from home. This includes undergraduate hourly students: you are welcome to take the time off, or Mark can work with you to develop a plan for literature-based work from home to be paid for hours that would have been spent in lab. If the lab can provide equipment to facilitate work at home (computer, hard drives, scanners, etc.) please discuss this with me.

1. **Pay attention to your physical health.** The CDC has up-to-date information on [COVID-19 symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). If you have any of these symptoms remain at home. If your roommates/family have any of these symptoms remain at home. You are not slacking; you are taking responsible steps to limit the spread of a pandemic. If you have not had your flu shot, contact your doctor/UHS about obtaining that now. While it does not protect against COVID-19, it will help protect you during this time in which hospitals are rapidly filling.

1. **Pay attention to your mental health.** This is a scary and unpredictable time. Each of us is different, so I offer just a few suggestions here that may or may not be useful. Feel free to take personal time as needed. Convene virtually: Skype "Happy Hours" with friends can be pretty fun and good for all of us. Stay tuned to changes in the news to be aware of the rapidly changing situation; but also recognize when too much news or social media can be damaging for you.

1. **Avoid public transit, taxis, and ride-shares.** Here are options:
    - Work from home.
    - Walk/bike to work.
    - Drive to work. Note that [as of 2020-03-15 surface lots on campus are available to park in for free](https://transportation.wisc.edu/2020/03/12/operational-response-to-covid-19/). Check Transportation Services regularly for updates here.

1. **Wash hands regularly with soap and water.** This includes on every entry to the lab. Do the full 20 seconds!

1. **Avoid face-to-face interactions and remain 6-10 feet away from other people, in the lab and in your life broadly.** To facilitate this:
    - Work from home.
    - Use video chat instead of in-person meetings, both for work and for friends.
    - Limit of one researcher per bay. This includes a limit of one student hourly working at a time.
    - Small office rooms are reserved for 1 person at a time.
    - Avoid physical contact. Wave instead of shaking hands.
    - Disinfect surfaces in the room with 70% ethanol between people.

1. **Skype office hours.** I will be quite available all of the time, and you should call me via video chat any time you would like. However, I will block off 1:00 pm - 2:00 pm every day as a designated time to be sure that you can reach me easily. If another time is better for you I can add hours too. **On Wednesdays at 1:00 pm, let's all Skype together briefly** to be sure we keep in touch as a lab.

## Take the following steps to prepare for additional restrictions

1. Plan for a period soon in which the lab will be fully closed:
    - Ensure that strains you are making are deposited in the collection. 
    - Ensure that experiments in progress are labeled appropriately and stored in a manner that will keep for 2-3 months.
    - Scan/photograph any documents at lab that you will need for work at home.

1. Plan for an extended quarantine at home. Have some beans, rice, frozen vegetables, cereal, etc. so you can remain healthy as the society around us constricts. Try to have at least a month's supply of medication on hand, and talk to your doctor to request a 3-months supply.

1. In the event of a `Lab Closure, Animal Care Only` situation, which seems likely in the near future, the lab has designated individuals as "essential personnel" to care for animals in the event of a university closure. These should be the only people in the lab under this situation. No more than two individuals should be in the lab at the same time.

1. In the event of a `Full Lab Closure` situation, Mark will provide additional direction.
