# Mandel Lab Safety Plan for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19

Updated 2020-03-18

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 is presenting all of us with new challenges. The goals of this plan is to ensure the health of lab members, promote health in the broader community, prepare for experimental disruption, and ensure that research animals are treated humanely. As much as it is frustrating to have work delayed or deferred, COVID-19 is a serious disease. It is imperative that we protect ourselves and protect the greater community.

## Lab Operating Level

As of today, 2020-03-18, we are at the level of: `Lab Closure, Animal Care Only`.

1. Normal Operations
2. Restricted Operations
3. **Lab Closure, Animal Care Only - Current level**
4. Full Lab Closure

## Take the following steps for the current level

1. **Only visit the laboratory for animal care.** The laboratory and building are closed so that we can prioritize our personal health and limit community spread of the virus. If you have any experiments in process, or samples that need to be frozen, work in the next day or two to get those secured in conditions where they can be stored for the coming months. Scan/photograph any documents at lab that you will need for work at home.

1. **Maximum of one people per lab room.** Denise has offered to put together a schedule. Each day there should only be 1-2 people at the lab. If there are two people, then a maximum of one downstairs and one upstairs.

1. **Drive to lab and park for free.** Avoid public transit, taxis, and ride-shares. Most [surface lots are free](https://transportation.wisc.edu/2020/03/12/operational-response-to-covid-19/).

1. **Animal care is voluntary.** I appreciate everyone's dedication to humanely caring for our research animals. However, our personal health is most important. Please communicate if you no longer want to care for the animals. If we have few members left available we will need to shut the facility down. This is not a failure of us as individuals but a reality of this extraordinary situation.

1. **No undergraduates in the laboratory.** During lab closure, undergraduates should not be in the laboratory for any reason.

1. **Pay attention to your physical health.** The CDC has up-to-date information on [COVID-19 symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). If you have any of these symptoms remain at home. If your roommates/family have any of these symptoms remain at home. You are not slacking; you are taking responsible steps to limit the spread of a pandemic. Keep in touch if you are ill so that the lab can support you.

1. **Pay attention to your mental health.** This is a scary and unpredictable time. Each of us is different, so I offer just a few suggestions here that may or may not be useful. Feel free to take personal time completely off of work as needed. Convene virtually: Skype "Happy Hours" with friends can be pretty fun and good for all of us. Stay tuned to changes in the news to be aware of the rapidly changing situation; but also recognize when too much news or social media can be damaging for you.

1. **If you require any resources to conduct your work at home, please let Mark know.** For example, computer, hard drives, scanners, software, etc.

1. **Wash hands regularly with soap and water.** Do the full 20 seconds!

1. **Skype office hours.** I will be quite available all of the time, and you should call me via video chat any time you would like. However, I will block off 1:00 pm - 2:00 pm every day as a designated time to be sure that you can reach me easily. If another time is better for you I can add hours too. **On Wednesdays at 1:00 pm, let's all Skype together briefly** to be sure we keep in touch as a lab.

1. **Plan for an extended quarantine at home.** Have some beans, rice, fresh and frozen vegetables, fresh and frozen fruit, cereal, etc. so you can remain healthy as the society around us constricts. Try to have at least a month's supply of medication on hand, and talk to your doctor to request a 3-months supply.

## Take the following steps to prepare for additional restrictions

1. Recognize that a `Full Lab Closure` may be needed. In that case, Mark will provide additional direction.
