# Mandel Lab Safety Plan for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19

Updated 2020-03-23

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 is presenting all of us with new challenges. The goals of this plan is to ensure the health of lab members, promote health in the broader community, prepare for experimental disruption, and ensure that research animals are treated humanely. As much as it is frustrating to have work delayed or deferred, COVID-19 is a serious disease. It is imperative that we protect ourselves and protect the greater community.

## Take the following steps

1. **Only visit the laboratory for animal care and associated animal experiments.** The laboratory and building are closed so that we can prioritize our personal health and limit community spread of the virus. Conduct any work at home that can be done from home. The lab has received approval for graduate students and postdocs to conduct limited experiments using animals that otherwise would be lost during this time, subject to the restrictions that were shared by email with that approval.

1. **Practice social distancing.** At any given time, there should be a maximum of two (2) people at lab, and a maximum of one (1) person per room. See the Google Doc Denise prepared for coordination. Limit your time in common areas, and ensure that you have 6-10 feet of distance between you and others.

1. **Practice good hygiene and disinfect after use.** Upon entering and before leaving the lab, wash hands with soap for 20 s. Disinfect surfaces near to your work (including desks) with 70% alcohol upon entering and before leaving.

1. **Drive to lab and park for free.** Avoid public transit, taxis, and ride-shares. Most [surface lots are free](https://transportation.wisc.edu/2020/03/12/operational-response-to-covid-19/).

1. **All lab work is voluntary.** I appreciate everyone's dedication to humanely caring for our research animals. However, our personal health is most important. You may change your mind at any time if you decide to no longer go to the lab. This is not a failure of us as individuals but a reality of this extraordinary situation.

1. **No undergraduates in the laboratory.** Undergraduates are not permitted in the laboratory for any reason.

1. **Pay attention to your physical health.** The CDC has up-to-date information on [COVID-19 symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). If you have any of these symptoms remain at home. If your roommates/family have any of these symptoms remain at home. You are not slacking; you are taking responsible steps to limit the spread of a pandemic. Keep in touch if you are ill so that the lab can support you.

1. **Pay attention to your mental health.** This is a scary and unpredictable time. Each of us is different, so I offer just a few suggestions here that may or may not be useful. Feel free to take personal time completely off of work as needed. Convene virtually: Skype "Happy Hours" with friends can be pretty fun and good for all of us. Stay tuned to changes in the news to be aware of the rapidly changing situation; but also recognize when too much news or social media can be damaging for you.

1. **If you require any resources to conduct your work at home, please let Mark know.** For example, computer, monitor, hard drive, scanner, software, etc.

1. **Wash hands regularly with soap and water.** Do the full 20 seconds!

1. **Skype office hours.** I will be quite available all of the time, and you should call me via video chat at any point. However, I will block off 1:00 pm - 2:00 pm every day as a designated time to be sure that you can reach me easily. If another time is better for you I can add hours too. **On Wednesdays at 1:00 pm, let's all Skype together briefly** to be sure we keep in touch as a lab.

1. **Plan for an extended quarantine at home.** Have some beans, rice, fresh and frozen vegetables, fresh and frozen fruit, cereal, etc. so you can remain healthy as the society around us constricts. Try to have at least a month's supply of medication on hand, and talk to your doctor to request a 3-months supply.
