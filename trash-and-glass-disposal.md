# Trash

## Tip Trash (the clear bag)
- Can be found in the orange wireframe holder near the main lab entrance. This can be treated as a “Dry” load, and can be autoclaved on P2.
- Once the run is finished, stick a green “Ok to Trash” sticker on the bag and toss it into the trashcan in the autoclave room.
- The liquid in the bin should just be autoclave steam and can be washed out down the drain and the bin left to dry/reuse.
  - If you cannot find ‘OK to Trash’ stickers in lab, you can find more on the first floor in the mail room by the printer.
## Biohazard Plate Trash (orange bag)
- The orange biohazard bags contain agar plates and cannot be run on a “Dry” load or they will boil over in the tray and make a huge mess. These must always be run on cycle P14, and the bags shouldn’t be so full that they bulge way out over the tray.
- Once the run is finished, stick a green “Ok to Trash” sticker on them and the bags should be tossed into the trashcan in the autoclave room.
  - **THE LIQUID IN THE TRAY CANNOT BE PUT DOWN THE DRAIN**. This isn’t water, but actually some melted agar that will resolidify and clog pipes if it goes down the sink.
  - Instead, take the tray to the “Daily Bin Bucket”, an instant ocean bucket you have put an orange autoclave bag into. Pour the liquid into the bag and rinse the tray clean in the sink of any remaining residue.
  - **AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU MUST TIE UP THE BAG, STICK AN “OK TO TRASH” STICKER ON IT, AND TOSS IT INTO THE AUTOCLAVE ROOM TRASH.**
    - Bin Buckets left to sit for >1 day will quickly grow new bacteria/mold and become a new biohazard/horrific stench glob. If you do run into this situation, autoclave the bag with the autoclave room’s door closed and toss it in the trash.
## Glass Disposal (White Cardboard Box)
- Once the glass disposal is filled about 75% of the way, remove the lid from the base carefully.
  - A good way to measure how full it is is to check if it is touching the line on the lid. If the glassware is up to or past this line, it needs to be disposed of ASAP!
- Take the cardboard tab and push against the lid.
  - You should no longer be able to see through the top of the lid.
- Place the lid back on the base and use packing tape to tightly secure the lid to the base.
  - Packing tape can be found scattered throughout the lab, or in a drawer over by the media bench above the cryovials.
- Place a filled out ‘OK to Trash’ sticker on the top and place it in the hallway to be disposed of.
- Look in the lab by the Biosafety hood for new glass disposals, over by the pipette tips. Assemble following the instructions on the box, or ask someone who has done it before. It can be tricky!
